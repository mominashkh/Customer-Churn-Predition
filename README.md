# Customer-Churn-Predition
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. The dataset is preprocessed, standardized, and split into training and testing sets. The KNN model is optimized using grid search, and the Decision Tree model is fine-tuned with adjusted probability thresholds to enhance prediction accuracy. The performance of both models is evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.

Key Features:

1. Data Preprocessing: Standardization of numeric features.
2. Model Selection: KNN and Decision Tree classifiers.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search for optimal KNN parameters.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
5. Probability Threshold Adjustment: Fine-tuning classification thresholds for improved prediction.

Use Cases:

1. Customer Retention Strategies: Identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention campaigns.
2. Subscription Services: Predict which users are likely to cancel their subscriptions.
3. Telecom Industry: Reduce customer turnover by analyzing churn patterns.
4. Financial Institutions: Assess customer loyalty and improve service offerings.
5. E-commerce Platforms: Analyze purchasing behavior to identify potential churn risks.

This project serves as a robust foundation for organizations aiming to proactively address customer churn and optimize retention strategies through data-driven insights.
